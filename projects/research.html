			<p>Although design has become more human-centered as a whole, it still fails to account for people with disabilities. Only eyeglasses have become ‘normal’ in today’s culture, and even sometimes desirable as a fashion accessory, but other aids for disabilities, such as wheelchairs or crutches, are still viewed with negative stigma. </p>

			<p>
				In the article, “How We Understand People and Why It’s Important”, the author explains the importance of social cognition in our ability to understand other people and helps us predict their behavior. The core idea is very similar to empathy and being able to put oneself in someone else’s shoes.
			</p>

			<p>
				In the research article about the Empathy of Pain, The authors observed that most studies are conducted with ‘members of western, educated, industrialized, rich and democratic societies’, and that little is known about empathy for people who are not members of those societies. Empathy is one of the key aspects of design that allows us to create things that really satisfy people’s needs. It involves coming to feel as another person feels. Research showed that the higher the socioeconomic status, the lower the empathy level.

				The first chapter of Disability Theory, by Tobin Siebers, discusses how disability studies can transform the way people think about identity, ideology, politics, social injustice, and the body. Language has also long been the dominant model for theorizing representation, but this disregards the embodied aspect of disability. The last thing the book will do is theorize disability as a minority identity. Disability has always been a medical matter, but now it has become less of an individual defect and more of a result of social injustice. Thus, disability studies does not treat disease or disability but rather studies the social meanings and symbols and looking at how they relate to exclusion and oppression. But in order for the field to move forward, it needs to account for both the positive and negative sides to disability, including the medical and social points of view.
			</p>

			<p>
				Ideology brings contradicting perspectives together. The ideology of ability is the preference for able-bodiedness. It makes us fear disability—the lesser the ability, the lesser the human being. People generally only feels the body when something goes wrong with it. Author claims that ‘identity’ has been rejected as a category in critical and cultural theory. The concept of ‘identity’ is only commonly used when talking about minorities. Identity is neither a liability nor a disability. It contains a variety of theories about navigating social environments. It’s not just something given to an individual or group but also encompasses ways of working through social locations and group history. Minority identity, in particular represent experiences of oppression.
			</p>

			<p>
				Minority groups have 4 qualities, the first of which is Identifiability. The definition of this can change with time and can consist of physical features as well as cultural. It is tied to the representation of difference, and being able to identify groups based off of those differences. The second quality is differential power. Minorities rely on differential power instead of numbers—numerical advantage is important but a better indicator is the presence of social power in one group over another. The third quality is pejorative treatment—minority groups experience both of these and it affects their economic standing, cultural prestige, educational opportunities, and civil rights. The fourth quality is group awareness, which refers to the perception of common goals pursued through cooperation. Minority identity calls for more social critique once it has been developed by groups that unite under the same thing to protest the oppression they have received. The last quality is the ethical test. Minority identities need to not only meet the previous 4 qualifications but also pass the ethical test. Their ideologies need to be ethical or else we cannot view them as a minority group subject to oppression.
			</p>

			<p>
				The author says, “Disabled people who pass for able-bodied are neither cowards, cheats, nor con artists but skillful interpreters of the world from whom we all might learn,” (p. 24).
The next step for disability studies is to develop a theory of complex embodiment that differs from the medical model and considers disability as a form of human variation. Some people have tried to implement disability simulations in order for others to get a better sense of what it is like to be disabled, but this has received negative feedback because it portrays disability in a negative light.

			</p>

			<p>
				I do not have a specific plan for my final project yet, but I hope that it can bring these ideas together ot bridge the empathy gap between designers and society and those with disabilities.
