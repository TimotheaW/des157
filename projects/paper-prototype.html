		<h3>Round 1</h3>
		<p>For my first paper prototype, I wasn't really sure what I was doing, so I made it really small. This made lots of things unclear for my partner/user that tried to interact with it because they couldn't understand what my project was about. As I explained it, they asked if people could make comments on the stories, so that was a feature I kept in mind. </p>

		<h3>Round 2</h3>
		<p>I made my second prototype larger and more detailedâ€”I used actual words for instead of drawing lines to substitute text. This gave the user a much better idea of what the project was about. I received feedback on adding an 'opt out' sort option if the user chooses the "tell" option but ends up deciding not to share. This also led me to see that I needed to include a 'tell' link in the navigation. I was also told that it would be necessary to add trigger warnings to the stories.</p>

		<h3>Round 3</h3>
		<p>Round three was done outside of class. Cherilyn and I put our feedback and ideas together and added filters and categories of mental health into our project. This would allow users to filter the kinds of stories they see, making it easier for them to find stories similar to theirs. This also led to an idea of providing specific resources dedicated to certain types of mental health.</p>
