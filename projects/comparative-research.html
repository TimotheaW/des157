			<p>Stefan Sagmeister’s “Happy Show” Exhibit that premiered in 2012 at the Institute of Contemporary Art in Philadelphia isn’t exactly tied to disability but is related in the way that it is somewhat the result of the designer’s personal journey to happiness and the nature of the subject. The show was more personal than what one would expect. He did extensive reading on positive psychology and also went to therapy to get advice from a doctor. The film he is making as part of the project also has a doctor on board as an advisor. Although I don’t find myself agreeing with Sagmeister’s conclusions about how the greatest happiness is found through having sex and eating rich, fatty foods, I think there is a lot to be taken from the whole immersive experience he creates out of happiness, something we all strive for personally but also uniquely as designers that aim to make others happy. I want my project to be immersive as well (although it will be web-based) and have a way of encouraging empathy for disabled people since they are a group that is still not often considered by digital. </p>

			<p>The need for eyeglasses is essentially a disability, yet it has become a social norm and glasses are viewed to be fashionable accessories—some people nowadays that don’t even need glasses to help them see still wear the empty frames as a conscious fashion choice. Overtime, perhaps designers got a little carried away. Most brands are also incredibly expensive and overpriced, easily being above $100-200. Warby Parker is unique because they turn this market back around to what it was originally meant for—to help people see. They offer fashionable glasses at affordable prices (around $100) and also allow their customers to try on up to 5 pairs before committing to buying one. They aim to make eyewear accessible again to those that need it. Their site’s interface design is also very simple and modern, making it easy for users to navigate the site to the products. A unique thing about their site compared to others is that they offer lots of details about each of the products they offer, including specifications about the materials and lots of photos of the frames on different types of faces so that the user can be informed about the best fit. I want to take inspiration from them in how they have brought the idea of glasses back to its origin and their efforts in making it as accessible as possible. With my project, I want to eliminate stigma around disability so that people would see that we’re all just people with varying degrees of “able”—no one is less than another. Why can’t hearing aids be seen as fashionable and “normal” as glasses? Or wheelchairs? Or Crutches?  </p>
