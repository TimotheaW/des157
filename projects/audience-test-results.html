		<h3>Audience Feedback</h3>
		<p>The audience feedback in class was really helpful in learning about how users would actually interact with my project and what they thought about it. There were definitely suggestions that I never considered and I also realized that some of the things that were clear to me were not clear to them. 
			We received suggestions on the overall flow of our prototype 3 in terms of how the "star" page feels like it should be the main page and the user should enter that first before going in to share their own story. This would also provide more context on where their story would go after they submit it. We also were advised to make other functions of the site more clear, such as making the navigation more obvious and making it more clear which stars could be clicked.
			All three of the testers said they really enjoyed seeing the Resources page because they thought it was really important to have a step of action instead of just gathering a bunch of stories in one place.</p>
